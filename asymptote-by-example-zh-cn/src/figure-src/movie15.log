You meant to type ## instead of #, right?
Or maybe a } was forgotten somewhere earlier, and things
are all screwed up? I'm going to assume that you meant ##.

I was expecting to see \hbox or \vbox or \copy or \box or
something like that. So you might find something missing in
your output. But keep trying; you can fix this later.

I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.
